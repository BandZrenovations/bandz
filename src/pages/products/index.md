        like this image. maybe its a summer kitchen maybe a hot tub or bar.
        Anyhow You should delete these and replace. The slightly harder Part is
        setting the font colors and formatting. that has to be done in code.
        Also I can add new inputs or map capability but that will eventually
        push you to hitting request quota and incurring cost. I will give you
        info regarding usage cost beyond the free deployment level.
