        like this image. maybe its a summer kitchen maybe a hot tub or bar.
        Anyhow You should delete these and replace. The slightly harder Part is
        setting the font colors and formatting. that has to be done in code.
        Also I can add new inputs or map capability but that will eventually
        push you to hitting request quota and incurring cost. I will give you
        info regarding usage cost beyond the free deployment level.

        Dog Not Included. Point is you can add whatever you want to this to sell
        the properties along side an image. all of this can be added or deleted
        in Admin.
