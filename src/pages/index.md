      text: ' Anyhow You should delete these and replace. The slightly harder Part is setting the font colors and formatting. that has to be done in code. Also I can add new inputs or map capability but that will eventually push you to hitting request quota and incurring cost. I will give you info regarding usage cost beyond the free deployment level.'
